  <h1>About Unleashing Truth</h1>

  <p><strong>Unleashing Truth</strong> is a digital advocacy platform dedicated to dismantling the harmful myths surrounding pit bulls. Our mission is to educate the public, promote responsible ownership, and celebrate the loyalty and love these dogs bring to families across the country.</p>

  <p>This site was created by <strong>Summer Davis</strong>, a lifelong dog lover and proud pit bull parent. Summer’s dogs are more than pets—they’re family. Their well-being shapes every major decision she makes, from housing to career goals.</p>

  <p>Summer is actively involved in civic efforts to reduce shelter euthanasia rates and promote breed-neutral legislation. She believes that education is the key to changing hearts and minds, and that every dog deserves a chance to thrive in a loving home.</p>

  <p>Through Unleashing Truth, Summer shares real stories, training tips, and resources to help others become informed advocates. Whether you're a seasoned pit bull owner or someone curious to learn more, this site is here to empower you with facts—not fear.</p>

  <p>Join us in rewriting the narrative. Together, we can unleash the truth and give pit bulls the respect and compassion they deserve.</p>
